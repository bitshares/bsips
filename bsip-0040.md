# Abstract

# Motivation
The ability to escrow assets on BitShares is a desirable feature that could be used by many persons, services, and businesses. It permits conditional transfers between parties to occur that minimize or eliminate risks to a depositor/sender while conditions are being evaluated. Conditions for completion of a transfer can be evaluated by an escrow agent of some form whether a human and/or a software agent such as the blockchain agent. If all the conditions are evaluated to be true (a positive evaluation) during the evaluation period, then assets are transferred to an intended recipient(s). If the conditions are never evaluated to be positive (either due to an active evaluation or due to no evaluation whatsoever), then the assets are returned to the depositor(s).

# Rational
## Elements of a General Escrow Contract

An escrow contract is defined to have the following elements:

* parties to the escrow contract
* assets that are being escrowed
* escrow period start and end (expiry)
* conditions for escrow completion
* condition evaluators
* escrow agent and fee
* when and how frequently are escrow conditions evaluated
* what occurs when all conditions are satisfied
* what occurs at conclusion of escrow period if all the conditions have not been satisfied

### Parties

At least two parties must be defined for an escrow contract: at least one depositor, and at least one intended recipient. (Escrow agents are not defined here to be a "party" of the escrow contract [**To-do**: perhaps use better terminology].

### Escrow Assets
An escrow involves a conditional transfer of ownership of at least one item from one party (a depositor) to another (an intended recipient). An escrow is used to temporarily hold **some or all** of these items while the conditions are being evaluated during the escrow period. Upon satisfaction of the escrow conditions, the escrowed items will be transferred to the intended recipient. If the conditions are not satisfied by the expiry then the escrowed items are to be returned to the depositor. If certain conditions are met, the escrowed items can be returned early to the depositor before the expiry with the approval of designated parties (e.g. either all participants of an escrow and/or by the escrow agent).

For definition purposes, let an item that will be transferred from Party A to Party B upon completion of the escrow conditions to be called Item AB. Let an item that will be transferred from Party B to Party A upon completion of the escrow conditions to be called Item BA.

### Conditions

The conditions of an escrow contract involve events about other people, assets, and/or actions that are beyond the control of the escrow agent. One such example is the transfer of property between the parties of the contract by means which the escrow agent can at most observe. Whoever or whatever will evaluate the conditions of a contract must somehow obtain information about these events, perhaps with assistance by the escrow parties (e.g. by providing proof of this external activity), to evaluate the conditions.

### Condition Evaluators

The evaluators of the conditions of an escrow condition can be designated in the contract to be tiered such that if the first tier cannot reach an agreement, then the second tier will be tasked with performing the evaluation.

For example, the first tier of evaluators could consist of the escrow parties themselves (e.g. Parties A and B). If the parties agree on the evaluation, then the escrow transfer can proceed according to the designated terms (e.g. transfer of Item AB from A to B if conditions are satisfied, or return of Item AB to A if the conditions are not satisfied before the expiry). If the conditions are not satisfied by the expiry, then the escrowed items will automatically be returned to their depositors.

### Timing of Condition Evaluation

The timing of a condition evaluation is quite flexible and can vary from a single occurrence at near the expiry, or periodically during the escrow period, and/or triggered by certain events or activities.


### Escrow Agent and Fee

An escrow agent can be used to perform distinct services:

- to evaluate the conditions of the escrow agreement;
- to hold the escrowed asset(s) during the escrow period; if holding the assets, to transfer the escrowed assets to the appropriate parties contingent on the condition evaluation

An escrow agent is often paid a fee for these services before the escrow period begins and regardless of condition evaluation.

If an escrow will be performing condition evaluations, it should be granted reasonable amount of time to perform the condition evaluation. Furthermore, to avoid allegations of negligence, an escrow agent can benefit from the ability to demonstrate that an evaluation of the conditions(s) with a negative outcome (a negative evaluation) was performed.

### What Occurs when Conditions are Satisfied

When all the conditions are evaluated to be satisfied, the escrowed assets are expected to be transferred to the intended recipient. This transfer could be automated or require human action to initiate.

### Early Termination of an Escrow Contract

TBD: When intended recipient or escrow agent decide to terminate an escrow contract early such that the assets are returned to the depositor

### Conclusion of Escrow without Satisfied Conditions

If an escrow contract concludes without all the conditions being satisfied, a typical escrow contract has the escrowed asset(s) being returned to the depositor. This might be automatic process, or might require an action by the escrow agent.


## Elements of a Blockchain Escrow Contract

An escrow contract on a blockchain can have certain qualities that are distinctive from a general escrow contract. Some of these differences are described in this section.

### Condition Evaluation on a Blockchain

#### Off-Chain Escrow Evaluation

Off-chain escrow evaluations involves either a human(s) or an off-chain agent(s) making the evaluation regarding escrow conditions (e.g. escrow agent, Etienne, evaluates whether Bob satisfied the escrow conditions before releasing an asset from Alice to Bob). If all conditions are evaluated to be satisfied by the appropriate escrow parties or agent, then they can indicate their approval to the contract, and then the defined contract transfers will occur. If the appropriate approvals are not granted by the expiry, then the escrow deposits will be returned to the depositors.

#### On-Chain Escrow Evaluation With Oracles

On-chain escrow evaluations with oracles involves an escrow contract that can be evaluated by the blockchain itself by reviewing data that is submitted by a trusted party who can observe events outside of the blockchain (oracle). An example of such data could be the  temperature at a location on a particular date. Such a contract would require the following:
- A contract state that consists in part on this temperature data (e.g. a decimal variable);
- a software contract that can interpret this data;
- a trusted oracle that can submit/update this information in the contract state.

A variation on this idea is where the contract state consists of a particular asset DEX price, market condition on the DEX, and/or an account balance on the DEX so that no new data  would be required. Under this variation the trusted oracles are account holders who initiate DEX transactions and the blockchain that processes those transactions.

Either evaluation involves a contract, similar in nature to the existing DEX market processing, being designed for a particular contract.

### <a name="automatic-transfer-upon-expiry"></a>Automatic Transfers Upon Expiry

Upon expiry of the evaluation period, the assets that are held by the blockchain will automatically be returned to their depositors.

### Agent and Fee on a Blockchain

With the use of a blockchain, it is possible for the blockchain to hold the escrowed asset(s) while the escrow agent merely performs the condition evaluation. (A variant of this notion is that an escrow could act as an oracle to submit raw data to the blockchain that permits the blockchain to perform the condition evaluation.) If no action is taken by the escrow, the  all escrowed assets will be returned to their depositors. (See [Automatic Transfers Upon Expiry](#automatic-transfer-upon-expiry))

When signaling that conditions were evaluated with either a positive or a negative outcome, it would likely be beneficial for the escrow parties and the escrow agent to optionally memorialize either evidence of the condition evaluation, or some sort of "link" or "hash" of the condition evaluation (cite Factom as an example). The ability to explicitly indicate a negative outcome by an escrow agent is beneficial to an escrow agent to reduce the likelihood of allegations of negligence by either of the escrow parties.

## Existing Escrow Proposals
The section describes various escrow concepts that have been proposed either for BitShares or for other blockchains or services in terms of the elements that have been defined above. This is intended to provide some background and comparison to the concepts that will be described below in [Possible Concepts](#possible-concepts).

**To-do**: LocalBitcoin type of escrow of fiat for BTC

**To-do**: Elaborate Steem Escrow

**To-do**: Elaborate Interledger

## Existing Graphene Features that are Similar to What is Needed for Blockchain Escrowing

[**To-do**: Consider moving this section elsewhere]

### BitShares Multi-Signature Account
One of the existing features of BitShares is the ability to have an account that requires multiples signatures by differently authorized parties [cite] and even hierarchical authorizations. This mechanism has the benefit of escrowing an asset within an account whose transactions can be authorized by different combinations of parties (e.g. either both the depositor and the intended recipient; only the escrow agent; the escrow agent and the depositor; the escrow agent and the intended recipient) and can transfer an asset towards any account.

This feature can actually satisfy the requirements for "off-chain evaluation" escrowing although it has the burden of requiring a unique account with the appropriate escrow agent and escrow participants for a specific ongoing escrow contract. One option to handle a specific contract would be to create a single-use account for this purpose. Another more technical option would be for the authorities on an account to be re-assigned to the escrow agent upon the completion or expiry of the contract, so that the escrow agent could re-use the account in a future contract by subsequently re-assigning among the agent, and future contract participants. This approach, however, is somewhat complicated, error-prone, and awkward.

### BitShares Proposals

One of the existing features of BitShares is the ability to have a proposal that is recorded on the blockchain and awaits the authorization of the requisite parties (e.g. M-of-N signatures). If the required authorizations are not given by the proposal expiry then no transfer will occur.

This feature alone falls short of what is needed because no asset is actually escrowed while the proposal is awaiting the necessary signatures to complete. Therefore there is no guarantee that the asset will be secured by the time that the final required signature is obtained.

### Steem Escrow

**To-do**: Elaborate

### Atomic Cross Chain Transfers
Atomic Cross Chain Transfers (ACCT) involves the transfer of one asset (Asset A) on one chain (Chain A) from one account (A1) to another account (A2) if another asset (Asset B) on another chain (Chain B) is transferred from one account (B2) to another account (B1). Either both transfer occur or neither do. This functionality has been prototyped between two Graphene chains by the Scorum team [cite].

This feature implicitly involves escrowing of Asset A on Chain A while waiting for authorization to complete the transfer to A2. The sub-feature of ACCT could either be duplicated for the escrowing envisioned in this BSIP, or generalized for use by both ACCT and this BSIP.

# Specifications

## <a name="possible-concepts"></a>Possible Concepts to Implement
The following will describe possible escrow concepts that could be implemented in BitShares.

### Concept A

|Element|Description|
|-|-|
|Parties|Depositor and intended recipient each have an account on the blockchain|
|Escrow Assets|A quantity of an asset that exists on the blockchain|
|Escrow Period Start and End|Defined in contract|
|Conditions|Conditions describe events that might occur on the blockchain (e.g. does the price of some asset rise above a particular price; etc.) or occur off-chain (e.g. did the escrow intended recipient send 50 fiat USD to the escrow depositor via a bank wire; etc.). These conditions are textually described and are intended to be interpreted by off-chain parties and agent.|
|Condition Evaluators|The condition evaluators are the off-chain depositor and intended recipient, or the escrow agent|
|Reporting on Condition Evaluation Outcome|Whichever off-chain entities are responsible for performing the evaluation must signal the outcome of the evaluation on the blockchain in order for the blockchain to resolve the contract under a positive evaluation.|
|Escrow agent and fee|An escrow agent has an account on the blockchain. The fee is defined and paid to the escrow agent [by whom is TBD] as a prerequisite to initiate the escrow contract.|
|When and how frequently are escrow conditions evaluated|When and how **can optionally be** textually described as a part of the escrow contract on the blockchain. A positive evaluation must be signaled on the blockchain during the escrow period.|
|Who or what evaluates those conditions|The escrow parties may elect to evaluate the conditions themselves unless and until either party requests the escrow agent to become involved. At that point, the escrow agent should, if he is responsible, evaluate the conditions **at least once during the escrow period**; whether the escrow agent performs this evaluation once or multiple times, or early or late during the escrow period is something that **might be** textually defined but which is not enforced by the blockchain. See [Reporting Conditions Evaluation](#escrow-reporting) for a description of actions that could be performed by an escrow agent to demonstrate ethical conduct.|
|What Occurs when Conditions are Satisfied|When conditions are signaled to be satisfied by the designated condition evaluators, the assets are automatically transferred to the intended recipient|
|Conclusion of Escrow without Satisfied Conditions|Escrowed assets are automatically returned to the depositors without any action by the escrow agent. See [Avoiding Appearance of Negligence](#escrow-negligence).|

#### Evaluation of Concept

This concept has the following weaknesses:

- It does not clearly delineate when an escrow agent can and should become involved because it is merely described in a textual format that can and need only be interpreted by the off-chain parties and escrow agent.
- It does not guarantee a sufficient amount of time, as negotiated between the escrow parties and escrow agent, for the escrow agent to perform the condition evaluation (e.g. the off-chain party might notify the escrow agent to be perform conditions evaluations only a few seconds before the expiry which is likely to be insufficient notice to properly evaluate the conditions)
- When an escrow agent is expected to become involved **might only** be defined in human-readable text, if at all, and therefore introduces ambiguity and opportunities for abuse by parties and for allegations of misconduct or negligence against the escrow agent.

Although this concept contains many of the elements that are often desired of an escrow contract, its weaknesses could be addressed by enhancing the concept with features than can be handled by a blockchain.

#### Technical Approach
TBD


### Concept B

This concept is the same as Concept A except that the escrow can only participate after being invited by either escrow party.  Differences are shown with **an emphasis**.

|Element|Description|
|-|-|
|Parties|Depositor and intended recipient each have an account on the blockchain|
|Escrow Assets|A quantity of an asset that exists on the blockchain|
|Escrow Period Start and End|Defined in contract|
|Conditions|Conditions describe events that might occur on the blockchain (e.g. does the price of some asset rise above a particular price; etc.) or occur off-chain (e.g. did the escrow intended recipient send 50 fiat USD to the escrow depositor via a bank wire; etc.). These conditions are textually described and are intended to be interpreted by off-chain parties and agent.|
|Condition Evaluators|The condition evaluators are the off-chain depositor and intended recipient **unless and until either party "invites" the escrow agent to become the sole evaluator by signaling this invitation on the blockchain**|
|Reporting on Condition Evaluation Outcome|Whichever off-chain entities are responsible for performing the evaluation must signal **a positive** outcome of the evaluation on the blockchain in order for the blockchain to resolve the contract under a positive evaluation.|
|Escrow agent and fee|An escrow agent has an account on the blockchain. The fee is defined and paid to the escrow agent [by whom is TBD] as a prerequisite to initiate the escrow contract.|
|When and how frequently are escrow conditions evaluated|When and how **can optionally be** textually described as a part of the escrow contract on the blockchain. A positive evaluation must be signaled on the blockchain during the escrow period.|
|Who or what evaluates those conditions|The escrow parties may elect to evaluate the conditions themselves unless and until either party requests the escrow agent to become involved. At that point, the escrow agent should, if he is responsible evaluate the conditions **at least once during the escrow period**; whether the escrow agent performs this evaluation once or multiple times, or early or late during the escrow period is something that **might be** textually defined but which is not enforced by the blockchain. See [Reporting Conditions Evaluation](#escrow-reporting) for a description of actions that could be performed by an escrow agent to demonstrate ethical conduct.|
|What Occurs when Conditions are Satisfied|When conditions are signaled to be satisfied by the designated condition evaluators, the assets are automatically transferred to the intended recipient|
|Conclusion of Escrow without Satisfied Conditions|Escrowed assets are automatically returned to the depositors without any action by the escrow agent. See [Avoiding Appearance of Negligence](#escrow-negligence).|

#### Evaluation of Concept

This concept improves on Concept A in the following ways:

- clearly delineates that an escrow agent should only become involved as the sole condition evaluator after being invited by either of the escrow parties
- the escrow agent can record the outcome of a single condition evaluation on the blockchain and thereby avoid the obvious appearance of negligence

This concept has the following weaknesses:

- The escrow agent can only record a single outcome of a single condition evaluation on the blockchain.  (A postive outcome only requires one signaling on the blockchain. In contrast, multiple negative outcomes cannot be recorded.)
- Neither the condition evaluation itself (e.g. the escrow agent looked at a bank statement on January 1 and found no record of a transfer, etc.) nor a proof of a condition evaluation is being recorded on the blockchain.
- It does not guarantee a sufficient amount of time for the escrow agent to perform the condition evaluation (e.g. the off-chain party might notify the escrow agent to be perform conditions evaluations only a few seconds before the expiry which is likely to be insufficient notice to properly evaluate the conditions)
- An escrow agent receives the fee regardless of performing any evaluation and of recording any evidence of the evaluation on the blockchain. See [Reporting Conditions Evaluation](#escrow-reporting) for a description of actions that could be performed by an escrow agent to demonstrate ethical conduct.

#### Technical Approach
TBD (something similar to Steem escrow is a good candidate for technical implementation)


### Concept C

This concept is the same as Concept A except for where **the emphasis** is added.

|Element|Description|
|-|-|
|Parties|Depositor and intended recipient each have an account on the blockchain|
|Escrow Assets|A quantity of an asset that exists on the blockchain|
|Escrow Period Start and End|Defined in contract; **an additional deadline (invitation deadline) must be specified within the escrow period that defines by when an escrow agent may be invited by either escrow party to begin conditions evaluation**|
|Conditions|Conditions describe events that might occur on the blockchain (e.g. does the price of some asset rise above a particular price; etc.) or occur off-chain (e.g. did the escrow intended recipient send 50 fiat USD to the escrow depositor via a bank wire; etc.). These conditions are textually described and are intended to be interpreted by off-chain parties and agent.|
|Condition Evaluators|The condition evaluators are the off-chain depositor and intended recipient **unless and until either party "invites" the escrow agent to become the sole evaluator by signaling this invitation on the blockchain**|
|Reporting on Condition Evaluation Outcome|Whichever off-chain entities are responsible for performing the evaluation must signal the outcome of the evaluation on the blockchain in order for the blockchain to resolve the contract under a positive evaluation.|
|Escrow agent and fee|An escrow agent has an account on the blockchain. The fee is defined and **escrowed for the escrow agent by the blockchain** [by whom is TBD] as a prerequisite to initiate the escrow contract. **The fee is transferred to the agent upon escrow expiry if (a) the escrow agent has _not_ been requested to participate by the invitation deadline, or (b) the escrow agent _has_ been requested to participate by the escrow agent deadline and the agent has submitted at least one report of conditions evaluation**|
|When and how frequently are escrow conditions evaluated|When and how can optionally be textually described as a part of the escrow contract on the blockchain. A positive evaluation must be signaled on the blockchain during the escrow period. **If an escrow agent is invited by the invitation deadline, then the agent will be expected to report on conditions evaluation at least once between the deadline and the expiry.**|
|Who or what evaluates those conditions|The escrow parties may elect to evaluate the conditions themselves unless and until either party requests the escrow agent to become involved **by the invitation deadline**. At that point, the escrow agent should ~~, if he is responsible,~~ evaluate the conditions **at least once during the escrow period** **if the agent expects to receive the escrow fee**.~~; whether the escrow agent performs this evaluation once or multiple times, or early or late during the escrow period is something that **might be** textually defined but which is not enforced by the blockchain. See [Reporting Conditions Evaluation](#escrow-reporting) for a description of actions that could be performed by an escrow agent to demonstrate ethical conduct.~~ **Reporting on conditions evaluation may or may not include a textual description of the evaluation or a proof of a textual description (which can be used to both maintain some privacy for the escrow parties and to minimize on fees associated with the length of a textual report). A report on conditions evaluation must also include the conditions evaluation outcome so that the blockchain can resolve the escrow contract.**|
|What Occurs when Conditions are Satisfied|When conditions are signaled to be satisfied by the designated condition evaluators, the assets are automatically transferred to the intended recipient|
|Conclusion of Escrow without Satisfied Conditions|Escrowed assets are automatically returned to the depositors without any action by the escrow agent. **If an escrow agent is invited to participate, an escrow agent should report at least one condition evaluation on the blockchain to avoid [avoid appearance of negligence](#escrow-negligence)**.|

#### Evaluation of Concept

This concept improves on Concept B yet has the following weaknesses:

- The quality of a condition evaluations report by an escrow agent might be variable yet would be sufficient to ensure itself of receiving the escrow fee from the blockchain
- If an escrow agent is invited, only a single report is required of the escrow agent by the blockchain for the agent receive the escrow fee.

#### Technical Approach
TBD


# Discussion
## <a name="responsible-escrow"></a>Responsible Escrow Behavior
### <a name="escrow-reporting"></a>Reporting Conditions Evaluation

An escrow agent could publish either a report or a proof of a report on the blockchain to demonstrate the evaluation of conditions.

A related feature could be that an escrow agent does not even receive payment until this reporting occurs at least once.

### <a name="escrow-negligence"></a>Avoiding Appearance of Negligence

To avoid the appearance of negligence, an escrow agent can report when conditions were evaluated and the outcome of that evaluation even when the outcome is negative in order to demonstrate alertness and avoid the appearance of being negligent as an escrow.

## Rating of Escrow Agents and Parties
A helpful though separation discussion pertains to the rating or evaluation of escrow agents themselves. Such a rating could be as simple as word of mouth, or performed by a third-party, or evaluated by the the parties to previous escrow contracts themselves and memorialized on a some system such as a website or a blockchain.

A similar argument could be made for evaluating the parties themselves.

## Dead-Man Switch
Escrow contracts involve transfers from one party to another that are contingent on certain events being observed. A variation on this idea is for a transfer to occur if certain events are not observed. An example of this is a "dead-man switch" wherein a transfer will occur **unless** a party signals activity before the expiry. Such an example bears all the same characteristics as an escrow contract **except** for how to handle the absence of a condition evaluation. For a blockchain escrow contract, the assets are returned to their depositors if no positive indication is given (see [Automatic Transfers Upon Expiry](#automatic-transfer-upon-expiry)). For a dead-man contract, the assets are delivered to the intended recipients if no positive indication is given by the expiry. Some of the work towards blockchain escrow might be reusable or generalizable for dead-man switch use cases (e.g. life insurance, posthumous asset transfers, etc).
