# Abstract
This BSIP proposes the addition of novel, generally-applicable asset handling functionality to BitShares. These additions will support the development of a wide range of financial decentralized applications (dapps), advancing BitShares as an alternative platform to existing Turing Complete Smart Contract Platforms (TCSCPs) for dapp development. Although TCSCPs will continue to offer more flexible capabilities, the proposed infrastructure will offer a simple, ready-to-use interface to dapp developers which will facilitate more rapid development and a reduced time to market compared with generic Turing Complete platforms, which require dapps to define their own infrastructure. Furthermore, dapps utilizing the proposed infrastructure will share a consistent, easy-to-visualize asset handling model which will become increasingly familiar to users of dapps based on BitShares, giving them confidence when using BitShares dapps that they understand how their assets are being handled and what options are available to them under contract.

# Context and Motivation
One of the main promises of blockchain technology is the processing and execution of "smart contracts," a formalized agreement between parties where the terms are evaluated and enforced automatically rather than relying on trusted intermediaries. Initially, there was Bitcoin, which offers a simple smart contract definition language allowing the transfer of digital tokens between cryptographic keys. Subsequently, the industry has created multiple Turing Complete Smart Contracting Platforms (TCSCPs), such as Ethereum and EOS, in order to provide more advanced smart contract definition languages which can specify any programmable algorithm as a smart contract.

BitShares was created as a financial services smart contracting platform, providing high-performance decentralized financial contracts including an asset exchange, stable-valued assets, recurring payments, and an advanced multi-signature named account system. This curated selection of contracts is developed and supported by a highly competent team of developers who are committed to the quality, security, and correctness of the supported smart contracts. These assurances of contract quality give BitShares an advantage over TCSCPs, where contracts are user-contributed with no expectation of testing or correctness standards; however, to date, neither the more flexible Turing Complete model nor the quality-assured Curated model have clearly succeeded, either in terms of developer support or user adoption.

This proposal is to implement within BitShares a general framework for smart contract asset handling, capable of supporting a great many decentralized applications (dapps) and real world smart contracts. The benefit of such a uniform asset handling framework, as opposed to the TCSCP approach of generally supporting any and all potential asset management designs, is twofold. Firstly, it provides, across all BitShares dapps, a simple and consistent representation of user funds, making it easy for users to understand and reason about the status of assets within the contract, and what options they have for moving assets through the contract. Secondly, specifying a particular structure for asset handling gives developers a clear path for implementing their dapp's asset management, reducing their task from the creation of a novel asset handling architecture for their specific dapp, to merely expressing their dapp's asset movement possibilities within an already-implemented and battle-tested framework.

With this asset handling infrastructure implemented, BitShares would enjoy significant advantages over TCSCPs for dapp development. A great deal of the complexity of designing and implementing dapps which handle user funds lies in the creation of secure mechanisms for holding funds within the contract, and the represention of these mechanisms to the user in a comprehensible fashion. By providing a simple and consistent framework for asset handling, BitShares offers developers a simpler and faster implementation path by providing sturdy and supported infrastructure for asset handling which provides users a familiar and consistent representation of the status of contract funds.

# Rationale
The proposed asset handling framework is a series of asset depositories called "tanks," which have one or more withdrawal mechanisms called "taps." Tanks are simple database objects which track a balance of asset contained within them. A tank has one or more taps on it, which allow withdrawing asset from the tank. Taps are locked such that only specific authorities can open them, and may have restrictions on when or why they can be opened or how much asset can flow through them. Taps are connected to other asset depositories, such as another tank, or an account, and when opened, the asset that flows through them are deposited there. More asset may be added to a tank at any time.

All tanks will be required to have at least one tap which is capable of draining the entire tank immediately. This tap can be thought of as an emergency release valve, and will typically have an authority requiring a supermajority approval of all contract parties. This tap will typically not be connected to any destination until and unless it is used. Its purpose is to handle scenarios where real-world conditions have gone outside the bounds of scenarios planned for under contract (for example, a contract party dies or is otherwise rendered incapable of completing the contract as negotiated), and it becomes necessary to renegotiate the contract mid-flight, potentially rewriting rules for how contract funds can be handled. In such emergent scenarios, it is imperative that the contract platform have a contingency that allows contract parties to reallocate funds based upon renegotiated terms, since the prior-negotiated rules of fund allocation may no longer be usable. In most cases, if the emergency tap is used, it will be connected to a new tank with newly negotiated taps immediately before it is opened, and all funds will be drained to the new tank.

Taps are somewhat more intricate than tanks, as they define the authorities, limitations, and requirements for opening them. First, a tap specifies an authority required to open it. Next, it specifies requirements to open it, such as a requirement for a written reason for the withdrawal, or an approval from a second authority. Finally, it specifies limitations as to how much asset can flow through it once opened.

The power of this model lies in its simplicity. It mimics how money moves in real-world contracts: a balance is locked up for a purpose in advance, when exactly how that balance will be spent is not yet known. As expenditures arise, they are paid out of the balance by an authorized party. Only certain kinds of expenditures can be paid from the balance, and in some cases, a justification or review is required. Eventually, the balance may need to be topped up to support further expenditures. It is anticipated that this model will be general enough to support many smart contract use cases.

A further advantage of this model is that it is easy to visualize, both the current state of contract funds, and the effects a transaction under consideration will have. This is crucial, as it allows the development of intuitive GUIs which represent the status of contract funds to users in a readily accessible fashion, giving them confidence that they understand how their money is being handled and how they can interact with it under terms of contract.

# Specifications
This proposal seeks to define five new types within the BitShares protocol, namely `tank_object`, `tap`, `tap_requirement`, `tank_attachment`, and `sink`. A `tank_object` is an object which contains a volume of asset. A `tap` is an object attached to a `tank_object` which is capable of releasing asset from the tank. A `tap_requirement` is a `static_variant` of various requirement types which can be attached to a `tap` to impose limits and requirements on when and why a `tap` can be opened, and how much asset can flow through it. A `tank_attachment` is a `static_variant` which may contain one of several structures to be stored on the tank to provide additional functionality for the tank or taps. Finally, a `sink` is a `static_variant` of various types which specify what shall be done with asset that has flowed through a `tap`. A `tank_object` has one or more `tap`s; a `tap` may contain zero or more `tap_requirement`s and is optionally connected to a `sink`. A `tap` must be connected to a `sink` before it can be opened.

When a `tap` is opened, the amount of asset to release must be known. A `tap` can be opened in one of two modes: to release a fixed amount of asset, or to release the maximum amount of asset available. In the former case, the amount to release is set in the transaction that opens the `tap`. In the latter case, the amount to release is determined by the `tap_requirement`s, or the amount of asset remaining in the tank, whichever is lower.

A `tap_requirement` is attached to a `tap` and locks the `tap` until certain conditions are met. `tap_requirement`s contain several parameters which are defined when the requirement is created, and may require arguments to be passed in the transaction when unlocking or opening the `tap`. Some `tap_requirement`s are stateful; requirement state is stored by the `tank_object`. Initially, the following `tap_requirement` types are specified:
 - `immediate_flow_limit` Specifies a fixed maximum amount of asset that may flow through the tap in a given opening
 - `cumulative_flow_limit` Specifies a maximum amount of asset that may flow through the tap before it locks permanently (works in conjunction with an `asset_flow_meter`)
 - `periodic_flow_limit` [Stateful] Specifies a maximum amount of asset that may flow through the tap before it locks until a predefined time period elapses (works in conjunction with an `asset_flow_meter`)
 - `time_lock` Specifies time periods during which the tap is locked
 - `minimum_tank_level` Specifies a minimum amount in the tank, such that the tap cannot drain the tank past that minimum
 - `review_requirement` [Stateful] Specifies a reviewer authority which must approve requests to unlock the tap
 - `documentation_requirement` Requires documentation of the reason for opening the tap, such as a cost justification, without requiring review of this documentation
 - `delay_requirement` [Stateful] Requires a delay before tap unlocks, with optional veto authority which can prevent tap from unlocking even after the delay expires
 - `hash_preimage_requirement` Requires a byte sequence which hashes to a predefined digest to unlock the tap
 - `ticket_requirement` [Stateful] Requires a ticket (see code specification below) signed by a predefined key granting permission to release a limited volume of funds
 - `exchange_requirement` [Stateful] Checks an `asset_flow_meter` (see tank attachments below) and applies an exchange rate to calculate the maximum flow limit

A `tank_attachment` is attached to a tank and provides additional functionality for the tank or associated taps. Attachments may be created to perform actions when certain events occur on the tank, track statistics, restrict what kinds of actions can be taken on the tank or who can take them, authorize updates to tank components, etc. Attachments can receive asset, but cannot store it, thus attachments which receive asset must specify a sink to deposit asset in once it is received. Tank attachments cannot directly move asset into or out of a tank; only taps can take asset out of a tank, and only sinks can put asset into a tank. Tank attachments may be stateful, and their state will be stored by the hosting `tank_object`. Initially, the following tank attachments are specified:
 - `asset_flow_meter` [Stateful] An attachment which can receive funds, and tracks the amount of asset that has flowed through it, then releases the asset to a predefined sink
- `deposit_source_restrictor` An attachment which restricts the permissible sources and paths for deposits to the tank, and rejects deposits which do not follow an appropriate path. A tank can have at most one attached `deposit_source_restrictor`
- `tap_opener` An attachment which, when it receives asset, queues a predetermined tap to be opened automatically after the current deposit stops moving
- `attachment_connect_authority` An attachment which allows a specified authority to update the sink a specified attachment releases asset to

A `sink` provides a common interface for moving asset within Tanks and Taps structures. At a data level, a sink is very small and simple, only storing the ID of the object receiving the asset; however, sinks will specify a global interface for receiving asset and processing that deposit. The sink interface will require the source and path of the asset to be specified, and this may be used when processing the deposit to trigger events, log statistics, or detect errors. Initially, the following `sink` types are specified:
 - An account ID, to which the asset will be deposited as a balance
 - A tank ID, to add asset to the tank balance
 - A tank attachment ID, to send asset through a tank attachment which can receive funds

**Asset Path Restrictions** By default, tanks can receive asset at any time from any source; however, if a tank is equipped with a `deposit_source_restrictor` attachment, deposits to that tank are checked and required to match one of the patterns expected by the restrictor. This utilizes the information collected by the sinks that assets flow through. Presently, asset can originate from an account or a tank, and it may flow through several tank attachments before settling again in an account or a tank.

Each step of this flow is directed using a `sink` type, and the sink interface will record the list of sinks the asset flows through on its path from its origin to its destination. When a sink deposits to a `deposit_source_restrictor` on a tank, the restrictor matches the full path of the deposit against several patterns, and if none of the patterns match, the deposit is rejected. All deposits to a tank equipped with a `deposit_source_restrictor` must travel through the restrictor.

**Tank Lifecycle** Once created, a tank can remain in existence indefinitely and can be filled and emptied many times. It is preferred, however, that unused tanks be destroyed. There are two mechanisms by which a tank is destroyed: first is by a destructor tap, and second is by the `tank_destroy` operation. A destructor tap is a kind of `tap` which can destroy the tank after the tank is emptied, if configured to do so by the `tap_open` operation. Any `tap` can be created as a destructor tap, but the emergency tap *must* be a destructor tap. This is expected to be the most common method of destroying a tank, as it can be done within normal usage of the tank. Alternatively, a tank can be destroyed by using the `tank_destroy` operation; however, this operation requires the emergency tap authority and is therefore unlikely to be frequently used in practice.

To incentivize the destruction of tanks that are no longer being used, a deposit of core asset is required to create a new tank. This deposit is held for the lifetime of the tank, and is released when the tank is destroyed. The deposit is returned to the account which pays the fee for the operation that destroys the tank; it is not sent through a `tap`.

**Restricted Assets** Some assets specify account whitelists or blacklists, to restrict which accounts may transact in that asset. It is desired that these assets be able to utilize the Tanks and Taps infrastructure without opening the possibility of using Tanks and Taps to circumvent the restrictions on asset ownership; therefore, a restricted asset check will be enforced in three instances. First, when asset is released through a `sink` to an account balance, a restriction check will be performed on that account, and if the account is unauthorized to handle the asset, the transaction which opened the `tap` will be rejected as invalid. Second, the account paying the fee for a transaction that opens a `tap` must be authorized to handle the asset which is released by the `tap`. Third, when a `sink` receives asset from an account, that account must be authorized to handle the asset. With these checks in place, restricted assets can be used in conjunction with the Tanks and Taps architecture without compromising the efficacy of the asset restrictions.

This proposal additionally seeks to add eight operation types to the protocol:
 - `tank_create` Creates a new tank, specifying taps, tap requirements, and sink connections
 - `tank_update` Updates a tank, adding or removing taps (including requirements and sinks)
 - `tank_destroy` Destroys a tank (fails if the tank contains asset)
 - `tank_query` Pass arguments to tap requirements or tank attachments to perform actions or comply with requirements
 - `tap_open` Release funds through a tap, passing arguments as necessary to satisfy tap requirements
 - `tap_connect` Connect a tap to a sink, defining a sink on the tank as necessary
 - `account_fund_sink` Move asset from an account to a sink (such as a tank)
 - `sink_fund_account` Virtual operation, generated when a sink deposits asset into an account balance

Additionally, three new committee parameters will be defined:
 - `max_deposit_path_length` The maximum number of sinks in a deposit path
 - `max_taps_to_open` The maximum number of taps a single transaction can open
 - `tank_deposit_amount` The amount of BTS required for a tank deposit

### Tank Queries and Arguments
Many of the tap requirements and tank attachments support modes of user interaction which may or may not result in the immediate movement of asset. Those interactions which do cause movement of asset are performed using the `tap_open` operation, and those which do not are performed using the `tank_query` operation. Both of these operations will accept arguments specifying what actions should be taken on which requirements/attachments.

Initially, the following tank attachment queries will be supported:
 - `asset_flow_meter`
   - Reset the meter to zero (No arguments)
 - `attachment_connect_authority`
   - Reconnect the specified attachment (Accepts a `sink` argument)

The following tap requirement queries will be supported:
 - `review_requirement`
   - Create a request to open the tap (Accepts a `request_type` argument and an optional string reason)
   - Resolve a request to open the tap (Accepts a request ID, a boolean decision, and an optional string reason)
   - Cancel a request (Accepts a request ID and an optional string reason)
   - Consume an approved request and open the tap (Accepts a request ID)
 - `documentation_requirement`
   - Document the reason for the release of asset (Accepts a string reason)
 - `delay_requirement`
   - Create a request to open the tap (Accepts a `request_type` argument)
   - Veto a request to open the tap (Accepts a request ID and an optional string reason)
   - Cancel a request (Accepts a request ID and an optional string reason)
   - Consume a matured request and open the tap (Accepts a request ID)
 - `hash_preimage_requirement`
   - Reveal the hash preimage and open the tap (Accepts a data buffer)
 - `ticket_requirement`
   - Redeem a ticket and open the tap (Accepts a `ticket_type` argument)
 - `exchange_requirement`
   - Reset the amount released and reset the meter (No arguments)

Please note that while this specification attempts to provide a sufficient level of technical detail to convey the essence of Tanks and Taps, some detail has been elided for brevity, and the final implementation may diverge from the specification in order to improve the correctness, stability, efficiency, maintainability, or functionality of the Tanks and Taps framework.

# Discussion and Summary for Shareholders
The proposed modifications to the BitShares protocol will add eight new operation types, one new database object, and three new committee-controlled chain parameters. These modifications add new features, and do not modify or restrict any existing features, and therefore all currently supported use cases should be unaffected. In return, however, the new features will provide a powerful platform for financial dapp and smart contract development, and this platform can be augmented to become even more powerful in the future, requiring only minimal changes to support additional use cases. The proposed changes, in conjunction with future updates will make BitShares increasingly suitable as a financial dapp platform, notably offering dapp developers simplified development and a reduced time to market as compared with Turing Complete Smart Contract Platform alternatives which offer greater flexibility at the price of increased complexity.
