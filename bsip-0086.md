    Title: Share Market Fees to with the BitShares Committee
    Author: Abit More <https://github.com/abitmore>
    Status: Approved
    Type: Protocol
    Created: 2019-11-29

    Worker: 1.14.245

# Abstract

This BSIP proposes a protocol change: Every time a trade is executed (limit order is filled) and
if there are market fees generated, a portion of the market fees goes to the `committee-account`.

Example: The committee percent of market fees is set to 50%, and 0.2% of trading volume is the set as market fee. 
Then 0.1% of trading volume goes to the `committee-account`.

# Motivation

The BitShares Committee needs more tools to generate income to support development.

# Rationale

A major activity in the **network** is trading assets. The asset owners make
profits in the form of market trading fees. 

Currently, the main tools for the **network** to generate income from asset 
trading activities are order flat fill order fee and flat order cancellation fee. 

It seems reasonable that the asset owners share some variable profits 
(a part of market fees) to the `committee-account`, to support development.

As a supporting measure, `committee-account` should be exempted from
white-listing restrictions, so that it is able to claim the vesting balances
and sell them for core token or other tokens to pay for development later.

# Specifications

## Protocol upgrade

A time will need to be scheduled for applying the change. In this document,
terms "before the protocol upgrade", "at the protocol upgrade" and "after
the protocol upgrade" may or may not be used to indicate things happen before
the scheduled time, at the scheduled time and after the scheduled time.

## New global parameter

Add a new global parameter `market_fee_committee_percent` which can be updated
by the committee only after the protocol upgrade.
Initial value of that parameter is `0%`.
Valid range of that parameter is `[0%, 100%]`.

## When processing market fees

The cut of market fees can go to `committee-account`'s vesting balances.

After the protocol upgrade, when splitting a non-zero market fee, firstly
split `amount * market_fee_committee_percent` (round down) to `committee-account`,
then process the remainder as before. The amount split to `committee-account`
should go to the vesting balance object whose type is `market_fee_sharing`.

## When checking asset authorities

After the protocol upgrade, when checking authorities (E.G. white-lists) of an
asset on an account, if the account is `committee-account`, let it pass.

# Discussion

* Other than [the "coin-days as market fees" proposal](
 https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/issues/191) which applies
 a discount to market fees to benefit core token holders directly, this BSIP
 seeks for a mechanism to increase the committee's income and benefit core token
 holders indirectly.

* Adjusting the fee schedule and committee percent in the referral program is
 another option to increase the committee's income, and is probably sufficient
 for funding development.

* In the original design, the purpose of market fees is to reward asset
 issuers for their work (e.g. gateway providers, or businesses built around
 PMs), while operation fees (`limit_order_create/cancel` in particular) reward
 the committee for performing its work. The separation of market/operation fees
 matches the separation of roles. Changing this may damage existing businesses.
 Thus this BSIP could be a bad idea from this perspective. Also note that the
 committee can profit from market fees by setting them on committee-owned tokens.

* This would be another motivation for businesses building on top of BitShares
 to get involved in the parameter governance process. The percentage can be
 `0` if it is more appropriate.

* Asset owners can specify a zero market fee percentage to get around the fee
 sharing, while still profiting by setting a higher deposit/withdrawal fee.
 It is uncommon nowadays probably because it is less convenient or attractive
 for their customers.

* Another strategy is to charge a committe market fee globally, independent of
 what the asset owner decides. It essentially removes the option to not set
 a fee from asset owners, which kills some freedom and would hinder non-profit
 use of the platform.

* It is possible that `committee-account` would accumulate a lot of tokens with no
 value and tokens which are unable or hard to be used to pay for development.
 It is a side effect. Hopefully there will be quite some usable tokens.
 The Committee will have to do some work to manage the tokens anyway.

* The Committee will be accumulating tokens which could potentially be used or
 not used for any purpose. In other words, this BSIP as currently written does
 not stipulate how those tokens will or will not be used by the Committee.

# Non-Technical Summary

This BSIP adds a tool for the Committee to impose a fee on market trading
fees for all assets which enabled market trading fee, thus it can increase income 
for the committee to support development. It may hinder businesses relying on Market 
Fees if the committee decided fee is high. The committee may need some efforts to 
decide on an appropriate value of the parameter and manage their income.
