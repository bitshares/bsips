Abstract
----------------

polkaBTC is a full reserve distributed gateway

polkaBTC "vault" is a contract that anyone can issue polkaBTC from - to any other party
witnesses run bitcoin spv nodes and post headers
the statistical mode of the headers are then a "BTC parachain" on the issuing chain
issuers post collateral much like borrowing an MPA
issuer must maintain collateral of core token on the issuing chain
or other token on issuing chain) at stochastic market rate
issuers can charge a fee to those who request or redeem polkaBTC
issuer collateral ratio, fees charged, and vault size is public rpc info
In practice, request and redeem work much like a gateway from the user level except:
    instead of judging gateways based on perceived trustworthiness
    you judge gateways based on fees charged
additionally polkaBTC is equivilent regardless of which user issued it

Motivation
----------------

Traditional IOU gateways require trusted third parties which have historically ended with "exit scams"

Rational
----------------

A smart contract XCLAIM style gateway ensures contractual performance through collateralization

Specifications
----------------

Witnesses upload bitcoin headers
Anyone can issue "polkaBTC" to anyone by locking BTC on Bitcoin Mainnet
Anyone with "polkaBTC" can redeem with any vault operator.  
vault operators must maintain collateral or be penalized. 


Discussion
----------------

see POLKABTC SPECIFICATION DOCS for details.   Of course we can debate what we'll name the token.   


Summary for Shareholders
----------------

BitShares gateway technology is a relic of the past that is a marginal improvement on CEX technology.
In both cases you are trusting a third party to issue tokens.
XCLAIM tech can allow BitShares a means to interact securely with Bitcoin
