# Abstract
Closing a short position comes with a risk of getting margin called if no spare funds are available to buy the long and reduce the debt to zero. This BSIP introduces a way to put the short position directly on the market.

# Rationale
Closing a short position with a healthy CR should come with no risk of getting margin called.

# Specification
Introduce a way that user can directly place orders to sell collateral in a margin position, and the received SmartCoins will be used to reduce the debt automatically.

User needs to define the amount to sell and amount to receive while placing the sell orders, and the 
price should be greater or equal to margin call price/MCR, to ensure the deposit position CR will not be reduced after the filling of the sell orders.

When a debt position is margin called with close short orders, 2 ways are possible to handle this:

1. System delete all the Close short position orders and place margin call orders.
2. System define a logic to check whether the margin call conflict with the close short orders, if yes than delete all the close short orders and place margin call orders, if not just place margin call orders.

When user adjust the debt position, system will check whether the target debt position conflicts with the close short orders, if yes than reject to adjust.
