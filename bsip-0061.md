# Abstract
BitShares allow to change permissions of account A to account A. See *Cycles* paragraph of https://bitshares.org/technology/dynamic-account-permissions for details. More information can be found here: https://steemit.com/blockchain/@hipster/sad-story-how-i-lost-bitshares-account

# Motivation
We offer to develop additional functionality "Prevent to create cycled accounts". This functionality will avoid to create or update account authority with circular dependencies in the future.

# Rationale
According to our investigation, BitShares has about 384 locked accounts with circular dependencies. Most of these accounts are locked by mistake. 

# Specifications

## Prevent circular dependencies
We must extend create and update account evaluators adding code that detect cycled authorities and throws exception in do_evaluate() method if cycle detected.
To avoid any misunderstanding of existing authorization mechanism we propose to reuse actual code of sign_state::check_authority(). Make template class traverse_authorities_state and parametrize it with approve() method. By default approve = signed_by(), an existing method of sign_state class. We add keys_available() method to resolve signing path. So, check_authority() returns true, if signing path fully ends with existing keys.

## Fix locked accounts
There are two approaches here:
    1) Automatic (unconditional)
        - Detect all locked accounts in first maintenance after hard-fork.
        - Find latest operation ("lock"-operation) among operations of cycled accounts. Do it for each cycle.
        - Undo all "lock"-operations. Find previous account update/create operation that changes authorities and redo it.

    2) Manual (on-demand)
        - Check if account is locked.
        - Find latest operation ("lock"-operation) in cycle.
        - Undo "lock"-operation.

# Discussion
Should we identify authority as locked in case of cycle only? Bitshares has *max_authority_depth* parameter. So, authorities with delegetion depth > *max_authority_depth* are potentially locked. Should we prevent this?

## Examples
Account A has key. Account B delegates it's authority to A - ok. C -> B - ok. D -> C - fail.
Transaction can never be signed by D. D exceed depth limit. Current depth limit in Bitshares = 2.
