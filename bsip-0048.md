# Abstract

The possibility of creating assets on the BitShares Blockchain is a core feature of our platform. However some things are too malleable when they should not be. Other things are not flexible when they should be.

Asset creators can create an asset with a maximum supply. However this maximum supply can be changed by the asset creator (issuer) anytime. This exposes token holders to the risk of their purchased asset losing value.

With this BSIP a flag will be introduced which forbids the modification of the maximum supply of an issuer created asset.

In addition, another new flag will be introduced that prevents any more tokens from being issued in the future.

And finally, the ability to change the precision of an asset will now be available as long as current supply is zero.

# Motivation

A flag to disable the modification of the maximum supply for issuer created asset will be implemented. This has benefits for both the participants and the asset creator. Asset holders are assured the value of their assets (tokens) will not be diluted by issuers creating more tokens. Asset creators are able to market the fact that the maximum supply is fixed.

A flag to disable issuing allows asset holders to be assured that the current supply will remain fixed, even if there are unissued tokens.

The ability to change the precision of a created asset adds flexibility in the asset creation process.

# Rational

The `disable_modify_max_supply` is a newly created flag in the `asset_issuer_permissions`. The flag can be activated to forbid the modification of the `max_supply` (`asset_object.options`). Once the flag is set to `true`, it can only be set to `false` if `current_supply` is zero.

The `disable_issue` is a newly created flag in the `asset_issuer_permissions`. The flag can be activated to forbid issuance of additional tokens. Once the flag is set to `true`, it can not be changed.

Changing the precision of an asset should be easily accomplished with an `asset_update_operation`. This causes no harm while the asset is not issued.

# Specifications

This BSIP comes with changes to the protocol, hence requires a propotocol upgrade. However the changes to the code are minor.

For `disable_modify_max_supply`:

1. Add the `disable_modify_max_supply` flag to the issuer permissions
2. Set `disable_modify_max_supply` to false for existing assets at hardfork time
3. Add a `can_modify_max_supply()` to the `asset_object`
4. Change the `asset_update_evaluator::do_evaluate` method to assert false for
    1. the setting of the `disable_modify_max_supply` flag to `false` if `current_supply` is not zero or
    2. the modification of the `max_supply` when the `disable_modify_max_supply` is `true`
   
For `disable_issue`:

1. Add the `disable_issue` flag to the issuer permissions
2. Set the `disable_issue` flag to `false` for existing assets at hardfork time
3. Add a `can_issue()` to the `asset_object`
4. Change the `asset_update_evaluator::do_evaluate` method to assert false for the setting of the `disable_issue` flag to `false` if it is currently `true`
5. Change the `asset_issue_evaluator::do_evaluate` method to assert false if `can_modify_max_supply()` returns false

To change the precision:

1. Add the `fc::optional<uint8_t> new_precision` to a new `asset_update_operation.extensions` struct.
2. Change the `asset_update_evaluator::do_evaluate` method to assert false if 
   1. `new_precision` exists and is not equal to `asset_object.precision` and `current_supply` is not zero
   2. `new_precision` causes `max_supply` to be an invalid number

# Risks

It is believed that the addition of `disable_modify_max_supply` and `disable_issue` will add security for asset holders.

The modification of the precision value carries no techincal risk, as asset creators will be unable to modify the precision once tokens have been issued. 

There is the risk to parties interested in acquiring the asset if the precision is changed after due diligence and before issuance.  

# Discussion

Using `disable_` as names for boolean values is not advisable and can lead to confusion. However, these names were chosen for compatibility reasons. See the comments [of a similar situation here](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/pull/1375#pullrequestreview-164580457).

# Summary for Shareholders

This BSIP proposes a way to improve the financial security of users against the dilution of a held asset. It also provides a mechanism for asset creators to modify the precision of their asset.
