# Abstract

The possibility of creating assets on the BitShares Blockchain is a core feature
of our platform. In the case of an ico, the ico-holders can create an asset with
a fixed maximum supply. However this maximum supply can be changed by the
asset creator (issuer) anytime. This exposes participators ico to the risk,
of loosing value of their bought asset.

With this BSIP a flag will be introduced which forbids the modification of the maximum
supply of an issuer created asset.

# Motivation

The implementation of a flag, to disable the modification of the maximum supply for 
issuer created asset, has effects for both sides. On the one side the security for the
participators or non-issuer users increases, because the value of their assets (tokens)
can't be manipulated by exposing the market to more created tokens. And on the other side
it is good marketing for the ico-hoders, because they can advertise with their fixed
maximum supply.

# Rational

The `disable_modify_max_supply` is a new created flag in the `asset_issuer_permissions`.
The flag can be activated to forbid the modification of the `max_supply` (`asset_object.options`).
Once the flag is activated, it can't be deactivated.

# Specifications

This BSIP comes with a change to the protocol, which requires a propotocol upgrade.
However the changes to the code are minor.

1. Add the `disable_modify_max_supply` flag to the issuer permissions
2. Add a `can_modify_max_supply()` the `asset_object`
3. Change the `asset_update_evaluator::evaluate` method to assert false for
    1. the deactivation of the `disable_modify_max_supply` flag
    2. the modification of the `max_supply` when the `disable_modify_max_supply` is set
  
# Summary for Shareholders

This BSIP proposes a way to improve the user security in the context of issuer created
assets.
