# Abstract

This BSIP proposes that witnesses prevent global settlements from happening by not permitting the 
published feed price to drop below the global settlement price &times; MSSR. This BSIP will only 
apply to specific smartcoins that are subsequently approved by _Poll Worker_ voting.

# Motivation

BitShares has a mechanism to handle debt positions whose collateral is valued less than the debt itself ("bad debt").  This mechanism is called global settlement ("black swan") and is triggered when the published feed price (FP) is less than or equal to the product of the global settlement price (P<sub>gs</sub>) and the maximum short-squeeze ratio (MSSR).

FP &le; P<sub>gs</sub> &times; MSSR

If this does occur it means that the collateral ratio (CR) of at least one debt position is less than the MSSR.

Global settlement is not a good way to handle bad debt, as can be seen to what happened to bitUSD.  After global settlement was triggered for bitUSD in December 2018:

- traders could no longer borrow bitUSD;
- the price of bitUSD dropped below USD because of insufficient collateral; and,
- it will take a long time for bitUSD to be revived.

The community has had extensive discussions about how to handle the bad debt in a better way in the future.  Two ideas have emerged about what should happen when bad debt appears.  At a high-level,

1. the ability to update the collateral of a debt position (debt position update) should still be enabled, and
2. the bad debt position should be handled independently of the good debt positions.

Before these advanced features can be implemented in the BitShares core software, this BSIP proposes an easy way to realize these benefits by something currently under the control of the witnesses.

# Rationale

Compared to a global settlement, this "global settlement protection" approach (GSP) will provide several benefits.

1. If a global settlement occurs the debt position update feature is disabled which is very troublesome to users.  But under global settlement protection, the collateral backing a debt positions can still be updated by the debt creators.

2. Under global settlement protection, the margin called orders can still be filled independently.  Their filling will cause the global settlement price to drop further and will also increase the collateral ratio of the remaining debt positions.  This can help to protect the smartcoin from devaluing.

3. Global settlement is always a great concern for BTS users.  Global settlement protection will remove the possibility of global settlements which will bring much confidence to users.

After the community abandoned BSIP-42, there is now a strong consensus that the feed price should be the market price.  Given this pre-condition, global settlement protection will ensure that this consensus does not cause future problems.

It is possible that the smartcoin may devalue even under global settlement protection (such as may happen if GSP needs to be activated by feed publishers).  However, if the community permits global settlement to be triggered, the devaluation will be even worse.

# Specifications

The global settlement protection price (P<sub>GSP</sub>) for an asset is defined as

P<sub>GSP</sub> = 1.01 &times; MSSR &times; P<sub>gs</sub>

Witnesses who publish price feeds should ensure that their published price feed (FP<sub>P</sub>) is greater than or equal to the global settlement protection price.  This can be calculated as

FP<sub>P</sub> = max(FP<sub>N</sub>, P<sub>GSP</sub>)

where FP<sub>N</sub> is the natural feed price

If there is no global settlement price, then the natural feed price should be used.

This BSIP provides a general solution to handle the issue of _bad debt_ smartcoins. Whether this BSIP
will be applied to any specific smartcoin will depend on voting results from a _Poll Worker_. Two 
related poll worker proposals, including FOR and AGAINST, will be created for voting on each specific
smartcoin.

# Potential Risks
One potential risk is that this BSIP may be misinterpreted as “price manipulation” or even “cheating” 
and hurt the trust on smart coin. Actually this BSIP may lead to obvious higher feed price than 
market price when bad debt emerge, but this does not lead to hurting to traders comparing to global 
settlement. The key point is that under this BSIP the global settlement price and also the feed price 
can still come down. However, under global settlement the settle price will be fixed. 

For the traders that issue force settlement, this BSIP can provide better price for smartcoin holders 
to settle. For the smartcoin holders, this BSIP can bring less devaluing of the smartcoin comparing to
global settlement. The only group that may be hurt is the debt position owners, as their debt position
may be settled at a lower price comparing to global settlement, but this is fair and is irrelevant to 
“price manipulation” or “cheating”.

# Summary for Shareholders

It is important to eliminate concerns about global settlement.  This can currently be achieved with the technical options that are available to the witnesses.
